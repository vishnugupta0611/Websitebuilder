## How to Test

### 1. Backend Test (Automated)
```bash
cd Websitebuilder
python test_profile_quick.py
```
This creates a test user and verifies all API endpoints work.

### 2. Frontend Test (Manual)
1. Start backend: `cd Websitebuilderbackend/builderbackend && python manage.py runserver`
2. Start frontend: `cd Websitebuilder && npm run dev`
3. Open browser test page: `Websitebuilder/test_profile_page.html`
4. Follow the test steps to verify API integration

### 3. Full User Experience Test
1. Register a new user or login with existing credentials
2. Navigate to Profile page (click user avatar → Account Settings)
3. Test all tabs:
   - Edit profile information and save
   - Add/delete addresses
   - View order history
   - Check settings options

## Test Credentials
Use the credentials generated by `test_profile_quick.py` or create new ones:
- Email: `[generated by script]@example.com`
- Password: `TestPassword123!`

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- New fields added to User model
ALTER TABLE builderapi_user ADD COLUMN company VARCHAR(200);
ALTER TABLE builderapi_user ADD COLUMN addresses JSON;
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/auth/profile/` - Get user profile data

### Key Components Updated
- `CustomerProfile.jsx` - Main profile page component
